## Project session summary

### What we changed
- Sidebar/Main layout: made `.sidebar` and `.main-content` display side by side and set the sidebar to full viewport height.
- Created `clients.html`: mirrored `issuers.html` structure with a client form and table; added reusable `.card` style.
- Interlinked navigation: updated navbars in `index.html`, `invoice-form.html`, `issuers.html`, and `clients.html` with correct active links.
- Unified layout: standardized pages to a single flex-based structure using `.dashboard` (wrapper), `.sidebar`, and `.main-content`.
- CSS consolidation: removed duplicate/competing styles for `.btn` and tables; kept global definitions with small variants.
- Responsiveness: added breakpoints for 1024px, 768px, 600px, and 480px to improve layout, forms, buttons, and tables across devices.
- Linting: resolved warnings; stylesheet currently reports no linter issues.

### Files added
- `clients.html`
- `CONVERSATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### Files updated
- `style.css`
- `index.html`
- `invoice-form.html`
- `issuers.html`

### Notes for use
- Open any of the HTML files directly in a browser; the shared CSS (`style.css`) handles all pages with responsive behavior.
- Sidebar remains full height on desktop; on mobile widths it stacks above main content.

### Next ideas (optional)
- Centralize typography by setting a single font stack in `body` and loading it once in all pages.
- Consider extracting colors and spacing into CSS variables at `:root` for easier theme changes.
